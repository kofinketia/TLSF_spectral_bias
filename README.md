# TSLF_spectral_bias
This is the source code for a paper **Exploring Spectral Bias in Time Series Long Sequence Forecasting** 

## Procedure for generating results

To obtain the graphs that the result of the spectral bias analysis, run 
- ``spectral_analysis-real_world_data.ipynb`` to get the results correspong to the *real world data*, 
- ``spectral_analysis-low_data.ipynb`` to get those corresponding to *low priority frequency data*,
- ``spectral_analysis-high_data.ipynb`` to get those corresponding to *high priority frequency data*,
- ``spectral_analysis-eq_data.ipynb`` to get those corresponding to *low priority frequency data*
